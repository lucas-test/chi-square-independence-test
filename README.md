# Chi square independence test

This is a pedagogical tool which aims to help to understand chi square independence test.
It can also helps to easily do such a test on a little data array.

Try it at [https://lucas-test.github.io/chi-square-independence-test/]

## Controls

- add columns and lines: click on the + button
- rename the columns and lines: click on the headers
- change the data values: click and edit on the left array
- change the data values: with the wheel of the mouse


## How to read the results?

If chi square < theoritical chi square then the data are considered independent.
Otherwise the data are considered correlated.

## Precise definitions

Given an nxm array of numbers:

- chi square: 
- pValue:
- theoritical chi square:
- Cramer value:
- freedom degrees: (n-1)*(m-1)
